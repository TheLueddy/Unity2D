  storyText: "You walk down the moonlit street of the abandoned town, wooden buildings
    being worn down to the complete lack of upkeep, \rthe smell of mould and mildew
    thick in the air. Even rain as light as this still holds the potential to wear
    away at your sword, but no matter, you've been sent to hunt, and hunt is what
    you must do. As you continue walking, you swear that you see something \r\nrun
    around the corner.\r\n\r\nWhat will you do next?\r\n\r\n1. Make haste and run
    after the mysterious figure\r\n2. Slowly follow around the corner\r\n3. Take
    a detour into the nearby abandoned tavern"
